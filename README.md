With over 15,000 AEDs in all of Belgium, one might expect that AEDs can provide key interventions and save lives in many cases of cardiac arrest, particularly in urban areas where a more dense population means more AEDs can be allocated.

However, it has been demonstrated that the placement of these AEDs within urban areas is sub-optimal. This project aims to optimize the placement of AEDs in urban areas of Belgium to improve coverage for cardiac arrest incidents. By employing a Maximum Coverage Algorithm, a better distribution of these AEDs is provided to increase the proportion of cardiac arrests with an AED nearby.
